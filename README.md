The celebrity quiz is designed to be fully interactive, utilsing event listeners to create a image flip function, the built in object, Math to allow random question selection with sound effects and a highscores leaderboard. It is designed to be responsive on multiple devices with a focus on simple, linear navigation. I chose this project mainly as a demonstration of the flexibility and range that Javascript allows.

# User Experience

The overall aim for this project was to build an, interactive and engaging quiz which could be enjoyed by anyone with no overall target audience other than celebrity fans. This target demographic is wide reaching and diverse. The quiz is designed so that questions can easily be added to expand the quiz. This enables it to remain interesting to both new and return users.

### Colours

The color scheme is uniform throughout the quiz using hex #234E70 for the blue background with hex #FBF8BE for the font color. Finally a complimentary navy was chosen for the quiz buttons (hex #0c1a25)

### Type Face
Throughout the site Roboto Slab has been used. It's an easy to read, neat font which doesn't distract from the overall appearance of the site.

In case Roboto Slab isn't supported in the browser sans serif is available as a backup. As with Roboto this is an easy to read font which is widely accessible on browsers so should always be available making it an ideal backup font.
